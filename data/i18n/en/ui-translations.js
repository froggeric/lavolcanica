  aboutBio: `It starts with a tremor, a deep, bone-rattling pulse from the planet’s molten core. Then the brass hits, a full-force tropical hurricane tearing through the static of a world gone numb. By the time the bassline drops, a runaway train on a rusty track, it’s already too late. You’re in it. This is La Sonora Volcánica, and resistance was never an option.\n\nThis is the sound of Frédéric Guigand, a Frenchman hijacked by the ghost of Latin America. His journey wasn't a choice; it was a sentence. He was dragged through the grimy battlefields of rock and jazz, did a tour of duty in a reggae outfit, and even served time in a circus orchestra, learning the mechanics of mania from the inside out. Then, the spirits exiled him to the desert wind of Fuerteventura, a black-rock island where ancient titans of stone brood over the ocean, sleeping with veins of fire, their immense silence a constant, humming threat.\n\nThere, in that crucible of fire and salt, he started forging the weapon. He took the blistering guitar lines of Peruvian chicha, ran them through the reverb-drenched guts of a ’60s surf amp, and hammered it all into a sound hotter and more unstable than lava. This wasn't music for the beach. This was music for the reckoning.\n\nBecause La Sonora Volcánica isn't about escape. It's about confrontation. It’s a full-throttle sermon aimed straight at the gilded cage of tradition, a soundtrack for tearing the mask off the bloody spectacle we call "art." The mission is to chronicle the grinning monsters who feast on innocence and the quiet victims they leave behind. It’s a bulletin from a fractured mind whispering that everything is fine, a heartbreak drowning its sorrows in a bottle of cheap liquor, searching for truth at the bottom. It’s the unholy trinity of Rubén Blades’ street-level reporting, Los Ángeles Azules’ hypnotic swing, and Charles Aznavour’s aching soul, all thrown in a blender with a lit stick of dynamite.\n\nThis isn’t just music. It’s a rhythm-fueled rebellion, an invasion of the heart and mind. For Frédéric, it’s a matter of simple, urgent truth. “Every rhythm, every lyric is a story waiting to be told,” he states, less an explanation than a warning. The eruption is coming. The fallout is inevitable. Which leaves his real question, the only one that matters, hanging in the air right before the beat drops: can you handle it?`,
