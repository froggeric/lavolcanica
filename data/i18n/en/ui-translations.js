  aboutBio: `Forget the quiet start. This begins in 1985, with a 14-year-old pushing raw data through primitive sound chips, bending silicon to his will on the computer demo scene. Two years later, Frédéric Guigand strapped on a guitar and mainlined the raw voltage of rock and blues.\n\nThe signal led him to England, where he chased the ghost of jazz, not just to play it, but to crack its code, decoding its sacred geometry through theory. Then, a hard left turn: back to France for a civil service stint that was anything but civil. He ran away and joined the circus—literally—trading the stage for the big top, blasting notes with the circus orchestra.\n\nBut the real rewiring was yet to come. As a DJ and later as the music curator for ZipDJ, he became a sonic shaman for DJs worldwide. He didn't just listen to Latin music; he mainlined it—a river of salsa, bachata, and merengue, and tens of thousands of cumbia tracks that permanently altered his musical DNA. He learned what makes a track ignite a dance floor, what makes a rhythm possess you.\n\nIn 2024, that knowledge exploded. La Sonora Volcánica was born. The first project: a series of instrumental albums paying tribute to the surf spots of Fuerteventura, fusing the psychedelic heat of '60s Peruvian chicha with the salt-sprayed cool of surf guitar.\n\nNow, the stories are being set loose, starting with the electrocumbia fever dream "Sol Sol." Collaborations are igniting with Mexico's cumbia outlaws, Los Mexaterrestres, and the soul-drenched Peruvian troubadour, Cututo. As Frédéric says, "Every rhythm, every lyric is a story waiting to be told."\n\nThis isn't background music. It's a seismic event. The only question is: are you ready for the shockwave?`,
