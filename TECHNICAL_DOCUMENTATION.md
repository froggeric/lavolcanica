# **La Sonora Volcánica: Technical Documentation**

**Version:** 1.0.7
**Audience:** Senior Software Engineers

This document provides a definitive technical analysis of the La Sonora Volcánica web project. It deconstructs the application's architecture, implementation patterns, and design rationale, serving as the primary onboarding resource for new developers.

---

## **1. High-Level Overview**

### **1.1. Project Purpose**

This project serves as the official digital presence for the musical artist "La Sonora Volcánica." It is a single-page application (SPA) designed to be an immersive, content-rich experience for fans. The primary objectives are to showcase the artist's music, provide biographical and collaborative context, facilitate discovery of the full discography, and serve as a central hub for all official streaming and contact links. The application is architected to be highly dynamic and easily updatable by modifying a central data source, without requiring direct manipulation of the DOM structure in the HTML.

### **1.2. Technology Stack**

The application is intentionally built with a "vanilla" technology stack, prioritizing performance, longevity, and minimal dependencies. This choice avoids framework overhead and potential obsolescence.

*   **HTML5:** Serves as the structural foundation.
*   **CSS3:** Provides all styling, responsive design, and animations. It heavily utilizes modern features like CSS Custom Properties (Variables), Grid, Flexbox, and `backdrop-filter`.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Manages all application state, dynamic content rendering, user interactions, and audio playback. The code is written in a modular, self-contained fashion, encapsulated within an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to maintain a clean global scope.

---

## **2. Software Architecture**

The application employs a **Component-based architecture** and a **data-driven, declarative rendering** pattern, implemented entirely in vanilla JavaScript. This approach mimics the core principles of modern front-end frameworks like React or Vue, but without the associated overhead.

### **2.1. Architectural Pattern**

The architecture can be described as a custom, lightweight **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** or, more accurately, **Model-View-Update** pattern.

*   **Model:** The "single source of truth" is a set of JavaScript objects and arrays (`releases`, `collaborators`, `translations`) defined at the top of [`script.js`](script.js:65). This data layer is completely decoupled from the DOM.

    ```javascript
    // script.js: Example of the 'releases' data model
    const releases = [
        {
            title: 'Cumbia del Barrio', year: '2025',
            coverArt: 'images/art-cumbia-del-barrio.jpg',
            audioSrc: 'audio/single-cumbia-del-barrio.mp3',
            featured: true,
            links: { spotify: '#', /* ... */ },
            story: `...`,
            lyrics: `...`,
            // ...
        },
        // ... more releases
    ];
    ```

*   **View:** The view is represented by the initial HTML structure in [`index.html`](index.html). It contains placeholder elements (e.g., `<div class="music-grid"></div>`) that act as mounting points for dynamically generated content. The view is intentionally non-descriptive of the data it will hold.

*   **Controller/Update Logic:** A collection of JavaScript functions serves as the controller and update mechanism. These functions are responsible for:
    1.  Reading from the **Model** (`releases`, `collaborators`).
    2.  Creating DOM elements programmatically (`createMusicCard`, `createCollaboratorCard`).
    3.  Rendering the created elements into the **View**'s placeholders (`populateFeaturedGrid`, `populateCollabsGrid`).
    4.  Handling all user events via a global event delegator.

### **2.2. Data Flow and Separation of Concerns**

The application enforces a strict one-way data flow.

1.  **Initialization:** On `DOMContentLoaded`, the main script initializes.
2.  **Data Read:** The `populate` functions read from the `releases` and `collaborators` arrays.
3.  **Render:** For each data object, a corresponding HTML component is generated and appended to the DOM.
4.  **User Interaction:** User actions (e.g., a click) are captured by a single event listener on `document.body`. This listener inspects `data-action` attributes to determine the user's intent.
5.  **State Change / Re-render:** Actions trigger specific functions (e.g., `showCollaborator`, `loadTrack`) which may read from the data models again to generate new views (like the side panel) or update the state of a specific component (like the audio player).

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns:
*   [`index.html`](index.html) is concerned only with the page's macro-structure and accessibility landmarks.
*   [`style.css`](style.css) is concerned only with the visual presentation and layout.
*   [`script.js`](script.js) is concerned only with data, state management, and rendering logic. Content updates are achieved by modifying only the data arrays within [`script.js`](script.js:62), a core principle outlined in the [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md:90).

## **3. HTML Deep Dive**

The HTML structure is semantic, accessible, and optimized for SEO.

### **3.1. Structure and Semantics**

The document uses modern HTML5 semantic elements to define the page structure, enhancing both readability and machine-parsability.

*   **Landmarks:** The page is clearly sectioned with `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` landmarks. Within `<main>`, `<section>` elements are used to delineate distinct content areas (`#hero`, `#music`, `#about`, etc.).
*   **Headings:** A logical heading hierarchy (`<h1>` through `<h4>`) is maintained, which is crucial for SEO and screen reader navigation.
*   **Content Placeholders:** The HTML acts as a template. Dynamic content areas are left empty, to be populated by JavaScript. This keeps the initial HTML payload small and clean.

    ```html
    <!-- index.html: Placeholder for dynamically generated music cards -->
    <section id="music" class="page-section">
        <h2 class="section-title" data-key="musicTitle"></h2>
        <div class="music-grid">
            <!-- Music cards will be injected here by JavaScript -->
        </div>
        <button class="cta-button discography-btn" data-key="discographyBtn"></button>
    </section>
    ```

### **3.2. Accessibility (ARIA)**

Accessibility is a first-class concern, implemented through several key patterns.

*   **Skip Link:** A "Skip to main content" link ([`index.html:67`](index.html:67)) is provided for keyboard users to bypass the navigation.
*   **ARIA Roles & Attributes:**
    *   The mobile navigation hamburger button uses `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` to communicate its state and function to assistive technologies.
    *   The side panel is implemented as a modal dialog with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-labelledby` to properly manage focus and context for screen reader users.
    *   The mini audio player is defined as a `role="region"` with `aria-live="polite"` to announce track changes non-disruptively.
    *   All interactive icons have descriptive `aria-label` attributes (e.g., `aria-label="Listen on Spotify"`).

    ```html
    <!-- index.html: ARIA implementation for the side panel -->
    <div class="side-panel" id="side-panel" role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-labelledby="side-panel-title">
        <div class="side-panel-header">
            <h2 class="side-panel-title" id="side-panel-title"></h2>
            <button class="close-panel-btn" aria-label="Close panel">&times;</button>
        </div>
        <!-- ... -->
    </div>
    ```
*   **Focus Management:** A JavaScript-based focus trap is implemented for the side panel ([`script.js:456`](script.js:456)) to ensure keyboard users cannot accidentally navigate to the occluded content behind the panel.

### **3.3. SVG Icon System**

An efficient SVG sprite system is used for all iconography. All icons are defined as `<symbol>` elements within a single, hidden `<svg>` block at the top of the body. This is a highly performant strategy that reduces HTTP requests and allows for easy styling of icons via CSS (`fill="currentColor"`).

```html
<!-- index.html: SVG Sprite Definition -->
<svg width="0" height="0" class="hidden">
    <symbol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" id="icon-spotify" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
        <path d="..."/>
    </symbol>
    <!-- ... more symbols -->
</svg>

<!-- index.html: SVG Sprite Usage -->
<a href="..." aria-label="Listen on Spotify">
    <svg class="icon"><use href="#icon-spotify"></use></svg>
</a>
```

## **4. CSS Deep Dive**

The styling architecture is modern, maintainable, and directly implements the principles from [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

### **4.1. Methodology**

The CSS architecture is a hybrid approach combining several best practices:

*   **BEM-like Naming:** A loose, BEM-style convention (`block__element--modifier`) is used for component-specific styles (e.g., `music-card`, `music-card-overlay`, `player-controls`). This creates scoped, predictable, and low-specificity selectors.
*   **Utility Classes:** A few key utility classes are used for common states, such as `.hidden` for toggling visibility.
*   **State-based Classes:** JavaScript toggles state classes on parent elements (e.g., `.nav-open` on `<body>`, `.active` on `.side-panel`) to trigger widespread stylistic changes, rather than manipulating individual styles directly.

### **4.2. Design System Implementation**

The design system defined in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md:7) is implemented directly using CSS Custom Properties (Variables) in the `:root` pseudo-class. This is the cornerstone of the site's theming and maintainability.

```css
/* style.css: Core design tokens as CSS variables */
:root {
    --bg-volcanic-night: #1a1a1a;
    --text-salt-crystal: #F0F0F0;
    --accent-lava-glow: #FF4D4D;
    --accent-canary-teal: #00C2A8;
    --font-heading: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
    --font-body: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    --player-height: 80px;
}
```

This allows for global changes to the color palette or typography by editing a single line of code.

### **4.3. Responsive Design**

A **mobile-first** approach is strictly enforced, as mandated by the design guidelines.

1.  **Base Styles:** All default styles in [`style.css`](style.css) target mobile viewports.
2.  **Progressive Enhancement:** A single media query ([`style.css:779`](style.css:779)) at the end of the file overrides and enhances the layout for larger screens (tablets and desktops).

    ```css
    /* style.css: Mobile-first grid definition */
    .music-grid {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Single column on mobile */
        gap: 2rem;
        /* ... */
    }

    /* style.css: Desktop override within the media query */
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
        .music-grid {
            /* Multi-column on desktop */
            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
        }
    }
    ```
This strategy ensures a baseline experience on all devices and simplifies the styling logic by co-locating all desktop-specific overrides.

## **5. JavaScript Deep Dive**

The JavaScript is architected for clarity, performance, and maintainability, avoiding external dependencies.

### **5.1. State Management**

*   **Application State:** As described in the architecture section, all content and configuration are stored in plain JavaScript objects (`releases`, `collaborators`, `translations`) at the top of the script. This acts as a centralized, in-memory database.
*   **UI State:** The state of the UI is managed via classes on DOM elements. For example, `body.nav-open` indicates the mobile menu is active, and `mini-player.active` indicates the audio player is visible. JavaScript's role is to toggle these classes; CSS handles the visual transition. This separation keeps the update logic clean.

### **5.2. Event Handling**

A global **event delegation** pattern is used for most user interactions. A single `click` listener is attached to `document.body`. This listener inspects the `data-action` attribute of the clicked element's hierarchy to determine the appropriate action to take.

```javascript
// script.js: Centralized event delegation
document.body.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    const actionTarget = e.target.closest('[data-action]');
    if (!actionTarget) return;

    const action = actionTarget.dataset.action;

    if (action === 'play-track') {
        // ... logic to find and play the track
    } else if (action === 'open-collab-panel') {
        // ... logic to find collab data and show panel
    }
    // ... other actions
});
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
*   **Performance:** Only one event listener is needed for dozens of potential actions.
*   **Dynamic Content:** No need to re-attach event listeners to elements that are added to the DOM dynamically.
*   **Declarative HTML:** The action for an element is declared directly in the HTML (`data-action="play-track"`), making the code's intent clear.

### **5.3. Key Algorithms & Asynchronous Operations**

*   **Dynamic Component Rendering:** The `createMusicCard` and `createCollaboratorCard` functions are factory functions. They receive a data object and return a fully-formed DOM element, complete with attributes, classes, and event-related `data-*` attributes. This is a core algorithm for translating data into view.
*   **Audio Playback:** The `mini-player` logic ([`script.js:749`](script.js:749)) is a complex state machine that handles asynchronous audio events. It correctly manages play, pause, seeking, loading, and error states. It uses `audio.play().catch()` to handle browsers' auto-play restrictions gracefully.
*   **Scroll Lock:** The `scrollLock` utility ([`script.js:36`](script.js:36)) prevents the background page from scrolling when a modal (side panel or mobile nav) is open. It calculates the scrollbar width and applies a `margin-right` to the `<html>` element to prevent layout shift, a sophisticated solution to a common UX problem.

### **5.4. Code Structure & Encapsulation**

The entire script is wrapped in an IIFE to prevent global scope pollution. `use strict;` is enabled for a more robust and less error-prone execution environment. Functions are well-defined and serve single responsibilities (e.g., `populateFeaturedGrid`, `showCollaborator`, `updateContent`). Where necessary, functions are exposed on the `window` object (e.g., `window.loadTrack`) to be accessible from the global event delegator, a pragmatic compromise for this architecture.

## **6. Cross-Cutting Concerns**

### **6.1. Performance Optimizations**

Several strategies are employed to ensure a fast and responsive experience:

*   **Image Optimization:** `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` are used on off-screen images (`<section id="about">` and below) to defer their loading until they are needed.
*   **Event Listener Caching:** Element selectors are cached at the top of the script (`const musicGrid = ...`) to avoid repeated DOM queries.
*   **Debouncing:** The `timeupdate` event on the audio player, which can fire rapidly, is debounced to limit the frequency of DOM updates for the seek bar and time display ([`script.js:844`](script.js:844)).
*   **Intersection Observer:** The CPU-intensive CSS animation on the hero background is paused via an `IntersectionObserver` when the hero section is not in the viewport, conserving system resources ([`script.js:1056`](script.js:1056)).
*   **Scrollbar-width calculation:** Layout shift on modal opening is prevented by pre-calculating the scrollbar width and applying it as a margin ([`style.css:37`](style.css:37)).

### **6.2. Security Considerations**

Though the site is static and has no user input fields, basic security best practices are followed:

*   **`noopener noreferrer`:** All external links (`target="_blank"`) use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent tab-nabbing security vulnerabilities.
*   **HTML Sanitization:** A `sanitizeHTML` utility function ([`script.js:11`](script.js:11)) is included for future use, demonstrating an awareness of XSS prevention, even if not currently used for the bio text which is trusted.

### **6.3. Error Handling**

*   **Audio Player:** The mini-player has robust error handling. It listens for the `audio.error` event and displays a user-friendly, non-blocking error message. It also gracefully handles playback promise rejections.
*   **Image Fallbacks:** The `onerror` attribute is used on dynamically generated `<img>` tags to load a placeholder SVG if the intended image source fails to load, preventing broken image icons.

    ```javascript
    // script.js: Image fallback mechanism
    img.onerror = () => {
        img.src = 'images/placeholder-album.svg';
        img.alt = 'Album artwork unavailable';
    };
    ```

### **6.4. Advanced CSS Tooltip Solution**

A persistent issue with CSS tooltips being clipped by parent containers with `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` was resolved with a robust, multi-layered fix. This solution is critical to the UI and should not be altered without understanding its principles.

**Problem:** The side panels (`.side-panel-content`) use `overflow-y: auto`, which creates a new stacking context and clipping boundary. Standard tooltips, positioned absolutely, were being cut off by the panel's edges.

**Solution:** The fix involves creating a new, higher stacking context specifically for the tooltips, allowing them to "escape" the clipping parent.

1.  **Establish Stacking Context on Interactive Areas:** The `streaming-links` container, which holds the tooltips, is given `position: relative` and `transform: translateZ(0)`. The `transform` property is the key; it forces the element into a new stacking context without any visual change.

2.  **Elevate Tooltip Z-Index:** The tooltip's pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`) are assigned a high `z-index` (e.g., `3001`) to ensure they render above all other content within the panel.

3.  **Ensure Parent Visibility:** The parent containers, including `.side-panel-content`, `.discography-list`, and `.music-card`, were updated to ensure they do not unintentionally clip their children. While the main panel must scroll, the immediate parents of the tooltips themselves are set to `overflow: visible`.

```css
/* style.css: Key aspects of the tooltip fix */

/* 1. Give the tooltip's immediate parent a new stacking context */
.discography-list .streaming-links {
    position: relative;
    transform: translateZ(0); /* Crucial for creating the stacking context */
}

/* 2. Ensure the tooltip itself is on a high rendering layer */
.discography-list .tooltip::before,
.discography-list .tooltip::after {
    z-index: 3001;
}

/* 3. Prevent the main scrolling container from clipping the new context */
.side-panel-content {
    overflow-y: auto; /* Still allows scrolling */
    overflow-x: visible; /* Allows horizontal breakout */
    transform: translateZ(0); /* Ensures its stacking context is well-defined */
}
```

This combination of `transform`, `z-index`, and careful `overflow` management ensures the tooltips render correctly across all panel types (discography, release info, collaborator) without compromising the scrollable behavior of the panels.
